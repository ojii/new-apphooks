This is a dirty playground to mess around with the new apphooks idea described
in https://github.com/divio/django-cms/issues/1498.

In this repo this is primarily achieved with monkey patches and manual signals.

Check out manage.py and app/models.py.

Once I fooled around enough, I'll make a proper branch in the django-cms repo.
